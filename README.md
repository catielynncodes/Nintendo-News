ABND Project 6 & 7 - News App Pt 1 and 2

The nanodegree news app project asks students to use the Guardian News API to fetch JSON data and integrate it into an app for readers to view news related to a certain topic.

My news app will be specifically for news related to Nintendo games, releases, etc. This is by only taking news content with the keyword 'Nintendo'. I do not use any of their logos.

Part 1 of this project utilizes the following:
- Parsing JSON data - displays article title, author, date, and section
- Date formatting for readability (such as Oct 5, 2018)
- Intents to web browser
- Loading indicator
- Response messages for no internet connection or no data to load

Part 2 adds the following:
- Settings menu, accessible from the action bar
- "Order By" options for Most Recent and Relevance
- EditText option for max. number of articles to view
